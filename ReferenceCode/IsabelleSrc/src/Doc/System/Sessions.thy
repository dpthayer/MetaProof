chapter {* Isabelle sessions and build management \label{ch:session} *}

text {* An Isabelle \emph{session} consists of a collection of related
  theories that may be associated with formal documents
  (\chref{ch:present}).  There is also a notion of \emph{persistent
  heap} image to capture the state of a session, similar to
  object-code in compiled programming languages.  Thus the concept of
  session resembles that of a ``project'' in common IDE environments,
  but the specific name emphasizes the connection to interactive
  theorem proving: the session wraps-up the results of
  user-interaction with the prover in a persistent form.

  Application sessions are built on a given parent session, which may
  be built recursively on other parents.  Following this path in the
  hierarchy eventually leads to some major object-logic session like
  @{text "HOL"}, which itself is based on @{text "Pure"} as the common
  root of all sessions.

  Processing sessions may take considerable time.  Isabelle build
  management helps to organize this efficiently.  This includes
  support for parallel build jobs, in addition to the multithreaded
  theory and proof checking that is already provided by the prover
  process itself.  *}


section {* Session ROOT specifications \label{sec:session-root} *}

text {* Session specifications reside in files called @{verbatim ROOT}
  within certain directories, such as the home locations of registered
  Isabelle components or additional project directories given by the
  user.

  The ROOT file format follows the lexical conventions of the
  \emph{outer syntax} of Isabelle/Isar, see also
  \cite{isabelle-isar-ref}.  This defines common forms like
  identifiers, names, quoted strings, verbatim text, nested comments
  etc.  The grammar for a single @{syntax session_entry} is given as
  syntax diagram below; each ROOT file may contain multiple session
  specifications like this.

  Isabelle/jEdit (\secref{sec:tool-jedit}) includes a simple editing
  mode @{verbatim "isabelle-root"} for session ROOT files, which is
  enabled by default for any file of that name.

  \begin{description}

  \item \isakeyword{session}~@{text "A = B + body"} defines a new
  session @{text "A"} based on parent session @{text "B"}, with its
  content given in @{text body} (theories and auxiliary source files).
  Note that a parent (like @{text "HOL"}) is mandatory in practical
  applications: only Isabelle/Pure can bootstrap itself from nothing.

  All such session specifications together describe a hierarchy (tree)
  of sessions, with globally unique names.  The new session name
  @{text "A"} should be sufficiently long and descriptive to stand on
  its own in a potentially large library.

  \item \isakeyword{session}~@{text "A (groups)"} indicates a
  collection of groups where the new session is a member.  Group names
  are uninterpreted and merely follow certain conventions.  For
  example, the Isabelle distribution tags some important sessions by
  the group name called ``@{text "main"}''.  Other projects may invent
  their own conventions, but this requires some care to avoid clashes
  within this unchecked name space.

  \item \isakeyword{session}~@{text "A"}~\isakeyword{in}~@{text "dir"}
  specifies an explicit directory for this session; by default this is
  the current directory of the @{verbatim ROOT} file.

  All theories and auxiliary source files are located relatively to
  the session directory.  The prover process is run within the same as
  its current working directory.

  \item \isakeyword{description}~@{text "text"} is a free-form
  annotation for this session.

  \item \isakeyword{options}~@{text "[x = a, y = b, z]"} defines
  separate options (\secref{sec:system-options}) that are used when
  processing this session, but \emph{without} propagation to child
  sessions.  Note that @{text "z"} abbreviates @{text "z = true"} for
  Boolean options.

  \item \isakeyword{theories}~@{text "options names"} specifies a
  block of theories that are processed within an environment that is
  augmented by the given options, in addition to the global session
  options given before.  Any number of blocks of \isakeyword{theories}
  may be given.  Options are only active for each
  \isakeyword{theories} block separately.

  \item \isakeyword{files}~@{text "files"} lists additional source
  files that are involved in the processing of this session.  This
  should cover anything outside the formal content of the theory
  sources, say some auxiliary {\TeX} files that are required for
  document processing.  In contrast, files that are loaded formally
  within a theory, e.g.\ via @{keyword "ML_file"}, need not be
  declared again.

subsubsection {* Examples *}

text {* See @{file "~~/src/HOL/ROOT"} for a diversity of practically
  relevant situations, although it uses relatively complex
  quasi-hierarchic naming conventions like @{text "HOL\<dash>SPARK"},
  @{text "HOL\<dash>SPARK\<dash>Examples"}.  An alternative is to use
  unqualified names that are relatively long and descriptive, as in
  the Archive of Formal Proofs (\url{http://afp.sf.net}), for
  example. *}


section {* System build options \label{sec:system-options} *}

text {* See @{file "~~/etc/options"} for the main defaults provided by
  the Isabelle distribution.  Isabelle/jEdit (\secref{sec:tool-jedit})
  includes a simple editing mode @{verbatim "isabelle-options"} for
  this file-format.

  The following options are particulary relevant to build Isabelle
  sessions, in particular with document preparation
  (\chref{ch:present}).

  \begin{itemize}

  \item @{system_option_def "browser_info"} controls output of HTML
  browser info, see also \secref{sec:info}.

  \item @{system_option_def "document"} specifies the document output
  format, see @{tool document} option @{verbatim "-o"} in
  \secref{sec:tool-document}.  In practice, the most relevant values
  are @{verbatim "document=false"} or @{verbatim "document=pdf"}.

  \item @{system_option_def "document_output"} specifies an
  alternative directory for generated output of the document
  preparation system; the default is within the @{setting
  "ISABELLE_BROWSER_INFO"} hierarchy as explained in
  \secref{sec:info}.  See also @{tool mkroot}, which generates a
  default configuration with output readily available to the author of
  the document.

  \item @{system_option_def "document_variants"} specifies document
  variants as a colon-separated list of @{text "name=tags"} entries,
  corresponding to @{tool document} options @{verbatim "-n"} and
  @{verbatim "-t"}.

  For example, @{verbatim
  "document_variants=document:outline=/proof,/ML"} indicates two
  documents: the one called @{verbatim document} with default tags,
  and the other called @{verbatim outline} where proofs and ML
  sections are folded.

  Document variant names are just a matter of conventions.  It is also
  possible to use different document variant names (without tags) for
  different document root entries, see also
  \secref{sec:tool-document}.

  \item @{system_option_def "document_graph"} tells whether the
  generated document files should include a theory graph (cf.\
  \secref{sec:browse} and \secref{sec:info}).  The resulting EPS or
  PDF file can be included as graphics in {\LaTeX}.

  Note that this option is usually determined as static parameter of
  some session (e.g.\ within its @{verbatim ROOT} file) and \emph{not}
  given globally or on the command line of @{tool build}.

  \item @{system_option_def "threads"} determines the number of worker
  threads for parallel checking of theories and proofs.  The default
  @{text "0"} means that a sensible maximum value is determined by the
  underlying hardware.  For machines with many cores or with
  hyperthreading, this is often requires manual adjustment (on the
  command-line or within personal settings or preferences, not within
  a session @{verbatim ROOT}).

  \item @{system_option_def "condition"} specifies a comma-separated
  list of process environment variables (or Isabelle settings) that
  are required for the subsequent theories to be processed.
  Conditions are considered ``true'' if the corresponding environment
  value is defined and non-empty.

  For example, the @{verbatim "condition=ISABELLE_FULL_TEST"} may be
  used to guard extraordinary theories, which are meant to be enabled
  explicitly via some shell prefix @{verbatim "env ISABELLE_FULL_TEST=true"}
  before invoking @{tool build}.

  \item @{system_option_def "timeout"} specifies a real wall-clock
  timeout (in seconds) for the session as a whole.  The timer is
  controlled outside the ML process by the JVM that runs
  Isabelle/Scala.  Thus it is relatively reliable in canceling
  processes that get out of control, even if there is a deadlock
  without CPU time usage.

  \end{itemize}

  The @{tool_def options} tool prints Isabelle system options.  Its
  command-line usage is:
\begin{ttbox}
Usage: isabelle options [OPTIONS] [MORE_OPTIONS ...]

  Options are:
    -b           include $ISABELLE_BUILD_OPTIONS
    -l           list options
    -x FILE      export to FILE in YXML format

  Report Isabelle system options, augmented by MORE_OPTIONS given as
  arguments NAME=VAL or NAME.
\end{ttbox}

  The command line arguments provide additional system options of the
  form @{text "name"}@{verbatim "="}@{text "value"} or @{text name}
  for Boolean options.

  Option @{verbatim "-b"} augments the implicit environment of system
  options by the ones of @{setting ISABELLE_BUILD_OPTIONS}, cf.\
  \secref{sec:tool-build}.

  Option @{verbatim "-x"} specifies a file to export the result in
  YXML format, instead of printing it in human-readable form.

section {* Invoking the build process \label{sec:tool-build} *}

text {* The @{tool_def build} tool invokes the build process for
  Isabelle sessions.  It manages dependencies between sessions,
  related sources of theories and auxiliary files, and target heap
  images.  Accordingly, it runs instances of the prover process with
  optional document preparation.  Its command-line usage
  is:\footnote{Isabelle/Scala provides the same functionality via
  \texttt{isabelle.Build.build}.}
\begin{ttbox}
Usage: isabelle build [OPTIONS] [SESSIONS ...]

  Options are:
    -D DIR       include session directory and select its sessions
    -R           operate on requirements of selected sessions
    -a           select all sessions
    -b           build heap images
    -c           clean build
    -d DIR       include session directory
    -g NAME      select session group NAME
    -j INT       maximum number of parallel jobs (default 1)
    -l           list session source files
    -n           no build -- test dependencies only
    -o OPTION    override session configuration OPTION
                 (via NAME=VAL or NAME)
    -s           system build mode: produce output in ISABELLE_HOME
    -v           verbose

  Build and manage Isabelle sessions, depending on implicit
  ISABELLE_BUILD_OPTIONS="..."

  ML_PLATFORM="..."
  ML_HOME="..."
  ML_SYSTEM="..."
  ML_OPTIONS="..."
\end{ttbox}

  \medskip Isabelle sessions are defined via session ROOT files as
  described in (\secref{sec:session-root}).  The totality of sessions
  is determined by collecting such specifications from all Isabelle
  component directories (\secref{sec:components}), augmented by more
  directories given via options @{verbatim "-d"}~@{text "DIR"} on the
  command line.  Each such directory may contain a session
  \texttt{ROOT} file with several session specifications.

  Any session root directory may refer recursively to further
  directories of the same kind, by listing them in a catalog file
  @{verbatim "ROOTS"} line-by-line.  This helps to organize large
  collections of session specifications, or to make @{verbatim "-d"}
  command line options persistent (say within @{verbatim
  "$ISABELLE_HOME_USER/ROOTS"}).

  \medskip The subset of sessions to be managed is determined via
  individual @{text "SESSIONS"} given as command-line arguments, or
  session groups that are given via one or more options @{verbatim
  "-g"}~@{text "NAME"}.  Option @{verbatim "-a"} selects all sessions.
  The build tool takes session dependencies into account: the set of
  selected sessions is completed by including all ancestors.

  \medskip Option @{verbatim "-R"} reverses the selection in the sense
  that it refers to its requirements: all ancestor sessions excluding
  the original selection.  This allows to prepare the stage for some
  build process with different options, before running the main build
  itself (without option @{verbatim "-R"}).

  \medskip Option @{verbatim "-D"} is similar to @{verbatim "-d"}, but
  selects all sessions that are defined in the given directories.

  \medskip The build process depends on additional options
  (\secref{sec:system-options}) that are passed to the prover
  eventually.  The settings variable @{setting_ref
  ISABELLE_BUILD_OPTIONS} allows to provide additional defaults, e.g.\
  \texttt{ISABELLE_BUILD_OPTIONS="document=pdf threads=4"}. Moreover,
  the environment of system build options may be augmented on the
  command line via @{verbatim "-o"}~@{text "name"}@{verbatim
  "="}@{text "value"} or @{verbatim "-o"}~@{text "name"}, which
  abbreviates @{verbatim "-o"}~@{text "name"}@{verbatim"=true"} for
  Boolean options.  Multiple occurrences of @{verbatim "-o"} on the
  command-line are applied in the given order.

  \medskip Option @{verbatim "-b"} ensures that heap images are
  produced for all selected sessions.  By default, images are only
  saved for inner nodes of the hierarchy of sessions, as required for
  other sessions to continue later on.

  \medskip Option @{verbatim "-c"} cleans all descendants of the
  selected sessions before performing the specified build operation.

  \medskip Option @{verbatim "-n"} omits the actual build process
  after the preparatory stage (including optional cleanup).  Note that
  the return code always indicates the status of the set of selected
  sessions.

  \medskip Option @{verbatim "-j"} specifies the maximum number of
  parallel build jobs (prover processes).  Each prover process is
  subject to a separate limit of parallel worker threads, cf.\ system
  option @{system_option_ref threads}.

  \medskip Option @{verbatim "-s"} enables \emph{system mode}, which
  means that resulting heap images and log files are stored in
  @{verbatim "$ISABELLE_HOME/heaps"} instead of the default location
  @{setting ISABELLE_OUTPUT} (which is normally in @{setting
  ISABELLE_HOME_USER}, i.e.\ the user's home directory).

  \medskip Option @{verbatim "-v"} increases the general level of
  verbosity.  Option @{verbatim "-l"} lists the source files that
  contribute to a session.
